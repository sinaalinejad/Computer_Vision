## Image segmentation using Region Growing (RG) method (Q3.ipynb)
In this assignment, I used a BFS algorithm to grow a seed. points that are similar to the seed, are in the same segment.  
For similarity, I used LAB color space (l: lightness, a: reg/green coordinate, b: yellow/blue coordinate).  

## Implementing Morphological Operations (Q6.ipynb)
- Erosion, Dilation, Open and Close morphology operations simply using numpy library.  
- Implementing the above operations using OpenCV too.  
- Finding the skeleton of an image
